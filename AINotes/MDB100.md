# MongoDB MDB100 Learning Notes

## Module 1: Introduction to MongoDB and Atlas

### What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of development and scaling. It is a NoSQL database that uses flexible documents instead of tables and rows.

#### Key Features:

- **Document-oriented**: Stores data in JSON-like BSON documents
- **Schema-flexible**: Fields can vary from document to document
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling through sharding
- **High Performance**: Indexing, in-memory processing
- **High Availability**: Replica sets for automated failover

### MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice.

#### Benefits of Atlas:

- **Multi-cloud deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure
- **Automated scaling**: Easy to scale up or down as needed
- **Security features**: Network isolation, encryption, role-based access control
- **Monitoring & optimization**: Real-time performance metrics and suggestions
- **Backup & recovery**: Automated backups and point-in-time recovery

### MongoDB Document Model

Documents in MongoDB are stored in collections (similar to tables in relational databases) and are represented in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("5f8d7a3b9d4568d1b4b6e7c9"),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip": "10001"
  },
  "interests": ["programming", "music", "hiking"]
}
```

#### Advantages of the Document Model:

- Natural representation of data (objects map to documents)
- Embedded documents reduce need for expensive joins
- Dynamic schema for agile development
- Polymorphism - documents in the same collection can have different fields

## Module 2: Storage and Retrieval Part 1

### MongoDB Data Modeling

Effective data modeling in MongoDB focuses on embedding related data within a single document when possible, rather than using the normalized approach common in relational databases.

#### Data Modeling Patterns:

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Embedding | One-to-few relationships | User with addresses |
| References | One-to-many or many-to-many | Products and categories |
| Bucketing | High-volume time series data | Sensor readings by time intervals |
| Schema versioning | Evolving schema | Adding version field to documents |

#### When to Embed vs. When to Reference:

- **Embed when**:
  - Data is accessed together frequently
  - One-to-few relationships exist
  - Data doesn't change frequently
  - The document remains under the 16MB limit

- **Reference when**:
  - Many-to-many relationships exist
  - Data is updated frequently and independently
  - Data is large and would exceed document size limits
  - Data needs to be accessed independently

### CRUD Operations

#### Create Operations

```javascript
// Insert one document
db.collection.insertOne({
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
})

// Insert multiple documents
db.collection.insertMany([
  { name: "Jane", age: 25, city: "Chicago" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 35, city: "Los Angeles" }
])
```

#### Read Operations

```javascript
// Find all documents
db.collection.find()

// Find documents matching criteria
db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })

// Find one document
db.collection.findOne({ name: "John" })
```

#### Update Operations

```javascript
// Update one document
db.collection.updateOne(
  { name: "John" },
  { $set: { age: 31 } }
)

// Update multiple documents
db.collection.updateMany(
  { city: "New York" },
  { $inc: { age: 1 } }
)
```

#### Delete Operations

```javascript
// Delete one document
db.collection.deleteOne({ name: "John" })

// Delete multiple documents
db.collection.deleteMany({ age: { $lt: 25 } })
```

## Module 3: Storage and Retrieval Part 2

### MongoDB Query Language

MongoDB provides a rich query language to retrieve and manipulate data.

#### Query Operators

- **Comparison Operators**: `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$nin`
- **Logical Operators**: `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, `$nor`
- **Element Operators**: `$exists`, `$type`
- **Array Operators**: `$all`, `$elemMatch`, `$size`
- **Evaluation Operators**: `$regex`, `$text`, `$expr`

#### Aggregation Framework

MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for data processing operations similar to SQL GROUP BY operations:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "active" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$category", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])
```

Common aggregation stages:
- `$match`: Filters documents
- `$group`: Groups by specified expression
- `$project`: Reshapes documents
- `$sort`: Sorts documents
- `$limit`, `$skip`: Pagination controls
- `$lookup`: Performs left outer join with another collection

### MongoDB Storage Engine

MongoDB uses the WiredTiger storage engine by default since version 3.2.

#### WiredTiger Features:

- **Document-level concurrency control**: Allows multiple clients to modify different documents in the same collection simultaneously
- **Compression**: Both data and index compression, reducing storage requirements
- **Snapshots and checkpoints**: Write-ahead logging for durability

### Transactions in MongoDB

Since MongoDB 4.0, support for multi-document transactions is available.

```javascript
// Start a session
const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
  const accounts = session.getDatabase("bank").accounts;
  
  // Debit from account A
  accounts.updateOne(
    { account_id: "A" }, 
    { $inc: { balance: -100 } }
  );
  
  // Credit to account B
  accounts.updateOne(
    { account_id: "B" }, 
    { $inc: { balance: 100 } }
  );
  
  session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  session.abortTransaction();
  throw error;
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```

## Module 4: Security

### MongoDB Security Model

MongoDB provides several layers of security features to protect your data:

#### Authentication

- **SCRAM Authentication**: Default mechanism
- **X.509 Certificates**: For client and member authentication
- **LDAP Authentication**: Integration with directory services
- **Kerberos Authentication**: Single sign-on

#### Authorization

MongoDB uses role-based access control (RBAC) to govern access to a MongoDB system:

| Built-in Role | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `read` | Provides ability to read data |
| `readWrite` | Provides ability to read and modify data |
| `dbAdmin` | Provides administrative capabilities |
| `userAdmin` | Allows to create and modify users and roles |
| `clusterAdmin` | Provides cluster management capabilities |
| `root` | Provides superuser access |

#### Network Security

- **TLS/SSL**: Encryption for client-server and intra-cluster communications
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to specified IP addresses
- **VPC Peering/Private Link**: In cloud environments

#### Encryption

- **Encryption at Rest**: Protects data stored in files
- **Encrypted Storage Engine**: Encryption at the storage layer
- **Client-Side Field Level Encryption**: Encrypt specific fields in documents

### Best Practices for MongoDB Security

1. **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable authentication and use complex passwords
2. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
3. **Enable Access Control**: Use role-based access control
4. **Network Isolation**: Run MongoDB in a trusted network environment
5. **Regular Auditing**: Monitor and audit database activity
6. **Keep MongoDB Updated**: Apply security patches promptly
7. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive information
8. **Backup Securely**: Ensure backups are encrypted and properly secured

## Summary

MongoDB is a powerful, flexible NoSQL database that offers:

- Document-oriented data model for flexible schema design
- Comprehensive query language and aggregation framework
- Horizontal scalability through sharding
- High availability through replica sets
- Robust security features

MongoDB Atlas simplifies deployment and management, allowing you to focus on application development rather than database administration.
